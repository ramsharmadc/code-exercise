## Building

To build the binaries:

```
   cargo build --release --all
```

The `interrupt.rs` example is omitted from the Cargo file to allow the remaining binaries to be built to the stable
channel.


## Running

Binaries will sit in `target/release`. To run, e.g. the 'version' example:

```
$ ./target/release/version
Current 0MQ version is 4.2.5
```
