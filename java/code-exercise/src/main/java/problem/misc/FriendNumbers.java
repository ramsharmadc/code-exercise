/**
 * Two numbers are called friendly if they share a digit. For example 1239 and
 * 9760 are friendly where as 1234 and 9876 are not. You are given N numbers and
 * you have to calculate the count of pairs of numbers that are friendly. Input
 * First line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. For each
 * test case, the first line contains N, the number of integers given. The next
 * N lines contain N integers. Constraint T <= 10, N <= 10 ** 4, Each given
 * number is between 1 and 10 ** 18 Output For each test case, print a line
 * containing the count of pairs of number that are friendly. Example Input: 2 5
 * 2837 2818 654 35 931 5 183 665 908 774 362 Output: 6 3
